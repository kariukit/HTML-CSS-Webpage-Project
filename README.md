# first-project-bootcamp

This was an on-the-job ticket challenge.

We were supposed to edit the HTML and CSS to make the website look like the mock-up image below;

The link below leads to the website I was able to come up with:


https://kariukit.github.io/first-project-bootcamp/


What I did learn from the exercise was;

1. How to communicate in the coding environment. This includes; how to comment on the HTML and CSS on the changes I have made so other people can understand the changes I made and advise accordingly

2. How to read someone else's code, understand what they are trying to communicate with the code, and come up with a plan on how to make the changes to meet the requirements.

3. How to use different CSS elements such as CSS layouts, positioning and floats

4. How link images to HTML file

5. How to write a proper Read Me file and add image to it

6. How to use and resolve issues on GitHub as well as push the update code
